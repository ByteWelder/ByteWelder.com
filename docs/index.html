The name is kind of a joke to me, because it isn’t nearly as anonymous as it sounds. Let’s take a deeper look at this feature!</p>

        <p class="post-excerpt"><p>The topic of gaming and networking was brought up on the <a href="https://korge.org">KorGE</a> Discord server.
This made me think about the various forms of networking stacks that I’ve encountered in the past years, and some of the different
considerations for their development.</p>

<p>The intention of this article is to give a glimpse into various approaches and considerations. It’s likely not complete or perfect,
but I hope it will be useful for developers that are somewhat new to networking for games.</p>
