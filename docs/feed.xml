  <summary>The Tactility community and I have been working on many aspects over the past year: devices, apps, quality-of-life features for developers, and much more. Let’s take a close look.    How it started  At the end of 2023, I got inspired by Flipper Zero and decided that there should be an application platform for ESP32 devices. I wrote about this in my previous post, which explains its roots and pa...</summary>

  <summary>Not a lot of my projects survive this long, so let’s take a look what made this one special.    How it started  It all started in December 2023, when I was considering to buy a Flipper Zero device.  I still don’t have one, but I got to borrow one from a friend (thanks, Hanneke!). Flipper Zero is a multi-tool/gadget for people who like to tinker with electronics or software. I won’t go into too ...</summary>

  <summary>I got inspired by Flipper Zero and started developing an application platform for ESP32 touchscreen devices.    Prologue  Some time in mid-December, I was wondering if I should buy a Flipper Zero device. The official website describes it as follows:     Flipper Zero is a portable multi-tool for pentesters and geeks in a toy-like body. It loves hacking digital stuff, such as radio protocols, acc...</summary>

  <summary>I’d like to share with you my latest project: Decktility!    For several years, I’ve been looking for a project where I could dump a bunch of creativity in. A project of my own, that would be challenging and rewarding. Preferrably a project that combines electronics and software. Handheld PCs always had a special place in my heart. Palm III was my first one, and a bit later I got my hands on a ...</summary>

  <summary>A few weeks ago, I joined the OpenPyrojet project. OpenPyrojet intends to build 3D printer technology based on thermal spraying. In this post, I’ll show you how I assembled the print head prototype.    This is what the finished print head looks like:    How does the printer work?  The feedstock of the printer is a mix of micrometer-sized particles (e.g. metals or ceramics) with a fuel source li...</summary>
