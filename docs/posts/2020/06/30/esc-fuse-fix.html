    <p>I ordered a bunch of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RushFPV Mini Tank Stacks</code> that were rated for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">30 A</code> and connected them to some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DYS Samguk 2600 Kv</code>
motors <em>without propellers</em>. This minimal load blew the fuse on the ESC, making the ESC unusable.
The result was that BetaFlight showed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0.01 V</code> when a lipo was connected.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A friendly RushFPV customer support representative stated that this stack wasn’t meant for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5"</code> quadcopters and motors with
such high <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Kv</code> values. In my opinion, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">30 A</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">30 A</code>, regardless of motor size, so I’m still under the impression
that this stack just can’t deliver what it says on the specifications.
Thanks to the help of the RushFPV CSR, I was advised to bridge the fuse.
I was given some pictures as a guide, but decided to make a comprehensive photo write-up myself.</p>

<p>These are the tools that I used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ultra-fine tweezers</li>
  <li>soldering iron with (thin) chisel tip</li>
  <li>copper wire (preferably single core)</li>
  <li>clippers</li>
</ul>

<p>If you plan to fix your own ESC, you should understand that removing the fuse (and shorting/bridging it) means that there is nothing preventing damage to the ESC if too much current is pulled through it. It can lead to smoke and fire if you abuse the ESC beyond its limits without this safety net.</p>

<p>First, let’s take a look at the fuse itself. It’s the green SMD component on the ESC:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/esc-fuse-fix/01_fuse.jpg" alt="broken fuse on PCB" class="center" /></p>

<p>As mentioned in the list of tools, I used a fine chisel tip:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/esc-fuse-fix/02_tool_chisel.jpg" alt="soldering iron chisel tip" class="center" /></p>

<p>Use the clippers to splice the wire length-wise. Then cut a smaller piece off that is a bit smaller than
the size of the fuse:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/esc-fuse-fix/03_wire_cut_small.jpg" alt="copper wire with piece cut off" class="center" /></p>

<p>Have your soldering iron on high heat (I put mine on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">425 C</code>) and add a little bit of solder.
This solder will help spread the heat on the SMD component:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/esc-fuse-fix/04_solder.jpg" alt="chisel tip with solder" class="center" /></p>

<p>Start holding the fuse with the tweezers. Don’t put a lot of force on it, but make sure you grab hold of it:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/esc-fuse-fix/05_hold_fuse.jpg" alt="holding fuse with tweezers" class="center" /></p>

<p>Bring the soldering iron to the fuse (don’t push hard) and gently pull the fuse off with the tweezers:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/esc-fuse-fix/06_lift_fuse.jpg" alt="fuse pulled off with tweezers" class="center" /></p>

<p>The ESC will now look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/esc-fuse-fix/07_lifted.jpg" alt="ESC without fuse" class="center" /></p>

<p>Add some fresh solder to the fuse pads. I used the sharp end of the chisel tip to set down my iron
in a stable manner, and then I fed a little bit of solder into it:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/esc-fuse-fix/08_tin.jpg" alt="ESC with tinned pads" class="center" /></p>

<p>Now place the tiny piece of copper wire, with the flat side down, between the ESC fuse pads.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/esc-fuse-fix/09_bridge.jpg" alt="copper wire between ESC fuse pads" class="center" /></p>

<p>Before you put the soldering iron down, make sure that you have some grip on the wire, as it will start
sliding a bit when the solder is flowing. To solder it, just put your iron down on the copper bit and
let the heat of the copper conduct into the solder and melt the solder into the copper:</p>

<p>That’s it, you’ve now bridged the fuse!</p>

<p>You can test as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Continuity test on fuse and ESC battery pads.</li>
  <li>Power on the ESC with a battery and a smoke stopper.</li>
  <li>Remove battery power, add the FC and do another power on test with the smoke stopper.</li>
  <li>Remove battery power, connect setup through USB, re-connect power (with smoke stopper) and verify the voltage readout in BetaFlight</li>
</ol>
